## 📦 Installation

### Step 1: Add the FORGE Marketplace

In Claude Code (terminal or VS Code):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add scottfeltham/forge-mcp
```

### Step 2: Install the FORGE Plugin

```bash
/plugin install forge
```

### Step 3: Initialize in Your Project

```bash
/forge-init
```

That's it! FORGE is now active in your project.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Create Your First Cycle

```bash
/forge-cycle
```

FORGE will engage in a conversation to build comprehensive requirements:
- Feature overview and goals
- Detailed requirements and user workflows
- Technical considerations
- Security and compliance needs
- Success criteria and metrics

### 2. Check Status

```bash
/forge-status
```

See your current cycle progress, active phase, and recommended next actions.

### 3. Validate Readiness

```bash
/forge-checkpoint <cycle-id>
```

Check if you're ready to advance to the next phase.

### 4. Advance Phase

```bash
/forge-advance <cycle-id>
```

Move to the next development phase after completing requirements.

## 📚 Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/forge-init` | Initialize FORGE with standards detection |
| `/forge-cycle` | Create new development cycle (conversational) |
| `/forge-status` | View cycle status and progress |
| `/forge-checkpoint` | Validate phase compliance |
| `/forge-advance` | Advance to next phase |

## 🤖 Specialized Agents

FORGE provides 7 specialized agents, automatically recommended based on your current phase:

- **🟦 Architect Agent** - System design, architecture patterns, technology selection
- **🟨 Developer Agent** - Code implementation, TDD practices, technical problem-solving
- **🟪 Tester Agent** - Test strategy, quality assurance, test automation
- **🟩 DevOps Agent** - Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment automation
- **🟥 Security Agent** - Security analysis, threat modeling, compliance
- **🟫 Documentation Agent** - Technical writing, knowledge management
- **🟧 Code Reviewer Agent** - Code quality, best practices enforcement

Agents are context-aware and provide phase-specific guidance with proper tool restrictions.

## 🔄 Development Phases

### 1. Focus 🎯 (Requirements & Planning)
- Build comprehensive PRD
- Design architecture
- Identify security risks
- Define test scenarios (MANDATORY)

**Active Agents**: Architect, Security, Documentation

### 2. Orchestrate 📝 (Task Breakdown)
- Break down into tasks
- Map dependencies
- Design test strategy
- Plan CI/CD pipeline

**Active Agents**: Architect, DevOps, Tester

### 3. Refine 🔨 (Implementation & Testing)
- Implement features (TDD)
- Write and run tests
- Code review
- Security validation

**Active Agents**: Developer, Tester, Code Reviewer

### 4. Generate 🚀 (Build & Deploy)
- Build artifacts
- Prepare deployment
- Update documentation
- Final testing

**Active Agents**: DevOps, Documentation, Tester

### 5. Evaluate 📊 (Measure & Learn)
- Measure success metrics
- Conduct retrospective
- Document learnings
- Plan improvements

**Active Agents**: All agents contribute

## ✅ Phase Validation

FORGE enforces quality gates at each phase:

- **MANDATORY requirements** block advancement until complete
- **RECOMMENDED items** show warnings but allow progression
- **Standards integration** enforces your project's existing tools
- **Clear guidance** on what's needed to advance

Example blocking conditions:
- Focus: Missing test scenarios, inadequate requirements
- Orchestrate: Insufficient task breakdown, missing test strategy
- Refine: Tests not passing, code review incomplete
- Generate: Build artifacts missing, documentation outdated
- Evaluate: Metrics not collected

## 🎨 Configuration

Plugin behavior can be customized via Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "forge.enforcePhaseValidation": true,
  "forge.autoGenerateDocs": true,
  "forge.conversationalPRD": true
}
```

## 📖 Philosophy

**"Invest time in Focus phase to save time in all other phases"**

FORGE is built on proven principles:

1. **Comprehensive requirements** prevent scope creep and rework
2. **Phase validation** ensures quality at each step
3. **Test-driven development** catches bugs early
4. **Regular commits** maintain clear history
5. **Agent specialization** provides expert guidance
6. **Standards integration** respects your existing tools

**ROI: 45% time savings through better planning and reduced rework**

## 🔗 Integration

FORGE automatically detects and integrates with:

- **Linting**: ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop, etc.
- **Testing**: Jest, Pytest, RSpec, Go test, etc.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.
- **Security**: npm audit, Snyk, SonarQube, etc.
- **Git Hooks**: Husky, pre-commit, etc.

FORGE adapts to YOUR project, not the other way around.

## 📊 MCP Server

The plugin includes the FORGE MCP Server with tools for:

- Project initialization (`forge_init_project`)
- Cycle management (`forge_new_cycle`, `forge_cycle_status`)
- Phase control (`forge_phase_advance`, `forge_phase_update`)
- Validation (`forge_checkpoint`, `forge_guide_next`)
- Learning capture (`forge_add_learning`, `forge_retrospective`)
- Agent invocation (`forge_invoke_agent`)
- Documentation (`forge_generate_docs`, `forge_decompose_prd`)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading
```bash
/plugin list  # Check if installed
/plugin reload forge  # Reload the plugin
```

### MCP Server Connection Issues
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Check server.js is executable
- Review Claude Code logs for errors

### Commands Not Working
- Verify FORGE is initialized: `ls .forge`
- Check for active cycles: `/forge-status`
- Restart Claude Code

## 📝 Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature
```bash
/forge-cycle "Add user settings page"
```

FORGE will ask about requirements, and guide you through building a complete PRD.

### Example 2: Complete PRD
```bash
/forge-cycle "API Rate Limiting" --description="Implement token bucket rate limiting..." --priority=high
```

With comprehensive description, cycle created immediately.

### Example 3: Check Progress
```bash
/forge-status cycle-123
```

View detailed progress, tasks, and recommendations.
