# FORGE MCP Project Analysis Request

As an AI assistant with access to FORGE MCP server, please analyze this project and configure FORGE appropriately.

## Analysis Tasks:

1. **Explore Project Structure**
   - Examine directory structure using available file tools
   - Check for src/, lib/, app/, or other code directories
   - Look for configuration files

2. **Detect Technologies**
   - Read `package.json` if it exists to identify frameworks
   - Check for language-specific files (.py, .go, .rs, etc.)
   - Identify build tools and test frameworks

3. **Assess Development Environment**
   - Check for existing `.forge/` directory
   - Look for AI context files (CLAUDE.md, etc.)
   - Verify `.git` repository status
   - Find CI/CD configurations

4. **Initialize FORGE Configuration**
   - Use `forge_init_project` tool with detected project type
   - Configure project-specific settings based on analysis
   - Set appropriate AI context for the project

5. **Create Development Context**
   - Update project context with detected architecture patterns
   - Document key technologies and patterns
   - Add coding standards and conventions if found
   - Create initial AI instructions for the project

6. **Provide Setup Summary**
   - List detected technologies and patterns
   - Explain configuration choices made
   - Suggest first development cycle
   - Highlight any special considerations
