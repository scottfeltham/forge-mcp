**Purpose**: Define what you're building and why.

### Required Outputs
- [ ] Problem statement and target users defined
- [ ] Testable success criteria written
- [ ] System Context diagram (C4 L1) created
- [ ] Clear boundaries on what you WON'T build

### Notes

<!-- Document Focus phase work here -->

---

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Orchestrate:Pending -->
## Phase 2: Orchestrate

**Purpose**: Break the work into session-sized pieces.

### Required Outputs

## Phase 3: Refine

**Purpose**: Define exactly what "done" looks like.

### Required Outputs
- [ ] Acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format
- [ ] Interface specifications documented
- [ ] Edge cases enumerated by category
- [ ] Constraints vs criteria documented
