## 📝 Notes

### Requirements
*AI assistant will help fill this section*

### Test Scenarios [MANDATORY - Must be completed in Focus phase]
*Link to test scenarios: [Not yet created]*
<!-- Test scenarios MUST be defined before any code is written -->
<!-- Use templates/test-scenarios.md as a guide -->
<!-- NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT TEST SCENARIOS -->

### Architecture Decisions
*To be determined during Focus phase*

### Parallel Task Opportunities
*Identify tasks that can be executed in parallel using subagents*
<!-- Consider parallel execution for:
     - Multi-aspect analysis (technical, security, performance)
     - Independent component development
     - Different test types (unit, integration, e2e)
     - Documentation tasks (generation, auditing, formatting)
-->

### Tasks
*To be created during Orchestrate phase*
