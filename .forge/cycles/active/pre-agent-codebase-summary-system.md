# Feature: Pre-agent codebase summary system

**Started**: 10/12/2025
**Status**: Focus Phase
**Priority**: high

## 📋 Progress

### Phase 1: Focus 🎯 [Active]
**Lead Agents**: Architect, Security, Documentation
- [ ] Gather requirements
- [ ] Define test scenarios (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Create/Update PRD in docs/prd/
- [ ] Design architecture (Architect Agent)
- [ ] Identify risks (Security Agent)

### Phase 2: Orchestrate 📝 [Pending]
**Lead Agents**: Architect, DevOps, Tester
*Tasks to be defined*

### Phase 3: Refine 🔨 [Pending]
**Lead Agents**: Developer, Tester, Code Reviewer

## 📝 Notes

### Requirements
Create a comprehensive codebase summary document that agents can reference to understand the project structure, architecture, and key components without repeatedly analyzing the same files. This will save token usage and improve agent efficiency.

## Goals
- Create a single source of truth for codebase understanding
- Document all key components and their interactions
- Provide architecture overview and data flow
- List all MCP tools and their purposes
- Document file structure and organization
- Include agent integration patterns

## Requirements
- Summary should be loaded before agent invocation
- Should cover: architecture, core components, MCP tools, file structure, development workflow
- Must be kept up-to-date as codebase evolves
- Should reduce redundant file reading by agents

## Success Criteria
- Agents can understand codebase from summary alone
- Token usage reduced on agent invocations
- No duplicate codebase analysis across agents
- Summary is comprehensive yet concise

### Test Scenarios [MANDATORY - Must be completed in Focus phase]
*Link to test scenarios: [Not yet created]*
<!-- Test scenarios MUST be defined before any code is written -->

### Architecture Decisions
*To be determined during Focus phase*

### Tasks
